### 1. **Importing Libraries**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

```

- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Used to create plots and visualizations.
- `yfinance`: A library to download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis (e.g., DataFrame operations).
- `numpy`: Provides support for numerical operations and array handling.
- `seaborn`: A visualization library based on Matplotlib that offers a more high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- `train_test_split`: A function from `sklearn.model_selection` to split the data into training and test sets.
- `RandomForestClassifier`: A machine learning algorithm from `sklearn.ensemble` for classification tasks.
- `accuracy_score`: A function from `sklearn.metrics` to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.

### 2. **Downloading Stock Data**

```python
data = yf.download('RELIANCE.NS', start='2021-01-01', end='2024-10-20')
data = data.ffill()  # Forward fill to handle missing values

```

- `yf.download`: Downloads historical stock data for 'RELIANCE.NS' (Reliance Industries on the NSE) between `2021-01-01` and `2024-10-20`.
- `.ffill()`: Forward fills missing data, which means filling missing values by copying the previous valid value.

### 3. **Removing Outliers**

```python
Q1 = data['Close'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = data['Close'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
data = data[~((data['Close'] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (data['Close'] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)))]

```

- **Outlier Detection**: The interquartile range (IQR) is used to detect outliers in the `Close` price.
    - `Q1` is the 25th percentile (lower quartile), and `Q3` is the 75th percentile (upper quartile).
    - `IQR` is the difference between Q3 and Q1.
    - The condition `(data['Close'] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (data['Close'] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))` identifies outliers that are outside the range of 1.5 times the IQR below Q1 or above Q3.
- **Removing Outliers**: The outliers are removed from the data using `data[~condition]`, where `condition` checks for outlier points.

### 4. **Feature Engineering**

```python
data['Daily Return'] = data['Close'].pct_change()
data['5_day_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
data['10_day_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['20_day_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['50_day_MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['5_day_std'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).std()
data['10_day_std'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).std()
data['20_day_std'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()

```

- **Daily Return**: The percentage change in the `Close` price is calculated to get the daily returns.
- **Moving Averages**: The rolling means (moving averages) are calculated for the closing price over different periods (5, 10, 20, 50 days).
- **Standard Deviations**: The rolling standard deviations are calculated for different periods (5, 10, 20 days) to measure the volatility of the stock.

### 5. **Creating Target Variable**

```python
data['Target'] = (data['Close'].shift(-1) > data['Close']).astype(int)

```

- **Target Variable**: This creates the target variable (`Target`), which is a binary classification:
    - If the stock's closing price the next day (`shift(-1)`) is higher than the current day's closing price, the target is `1` (Up).
    - Otherwise, the target is `0` (Down).
- `.astype(int)`: Converts the boolean result to an integer (True → 1, False → 0).

### 6. **Preparing Data for Machine Learning**

```python
data.dropna(inplace=True)

features = ['5_day_MA', '10_day_MA', '20_day_MA', '50_day_MA',
            '5_day_std', '10_day_std', '20_day_std', 'Daily Return']
X = data[features]
y = data['Target']

```

- **Handling Missing Values**: `dropna()` removes any rows with missing values.
- **Features and Target**: The features are the calculated moving averages, standard deviations, and daily return, while the target is whether the stock price will go up or down the next day.

### 7. **Splitting the Data**

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

```

- **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training and testing sets. 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing. `random_state=42` ensures reproducibility.

### 8. **Training the Random Forest Model**

```python
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

```

- **Random Forest Classifier**: A Random Forest model is initialized with 100 decision trees (`n_estimators=100`) and trained on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`).

### 9. **Making Predictions**

```python
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

```

- **Predicting Stock Movement**: The model is used to predict the stock movement (up or down) on the test set (`X_test`).

### 10. **Evaluating the Model**

```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

```

- **Accuracy Score**: The model's accuracy is calculated by comparing the predicted values (`y_pred`) with the actual values (`y_test`).

### 11. **Plotting Feature Importance**

```python
%matplotlib inline # Plot Feature Importance
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'feature': features, 'importance': rf_model.feature_importances_})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='importance', y='feature', data=feature_importance)
plt.title('Feature Importance')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

- **Feature Importance**: This visualizes the importance of each feature in predicting stock movement using a bar plot.
- **Feature Importance Calculation**: The feature importances are retrieved from the trained `rf_model`.
- **Plotting**: A bar plot is created to show which features are most important for the model’s predictions.

### 12. **Plotting Stock Price Predictions**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
plt.plot(data.index[-len(y_test):], data['Close'].iloc[-len(y_test):], label='Actual Price', color='blue', linewidth=2)

# Plot predictions
up_pred = data.index[-len(y_test):][y_pred == 1]
down_pred = data.index[-len(y_test):][y_pred == 0]

plt.scatter(up_pred, data['Close'].loc[up_pred], color='green', label='Predicted Up', s=50, zorder=5)
plt.scatter(down_pred, data['Close'].loc[down_pred], color='red', label='Predicted Down', s=50, zorder=5)

plt.xlabel('Date', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Price', fontsize=12)
plt.title('Stock Price and Predicted Direction', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
plt.legend(fontsize=10)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

- **Plotting Actual Stock Price**: The actual stock price is plotted over the test data period.
- **Plotting Predicted Directions**: Predictions are visualized with green dots for predicted price increases and red dots for predicted decreases.
- **Labels and Legends**: The plot is labeled for clarity, including the title, axis labels, and legend.

### Summary:

This code:

2. Removes outliers, calculates relevant features, and defines a target variable (up/down movement).
3. Splits the data for training and testing.
4. Trains a Random Forest model to predict stock movement.
5. Evaluates the model's performance and visualizes feature importance and stock price predictions.
